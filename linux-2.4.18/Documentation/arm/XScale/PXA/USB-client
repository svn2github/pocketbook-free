Subject: [PATCH] PXA-USB

Hi Nicolas,

one more patch...

This patch adds minimal USB client (UDC) support.

Some notes:
It adds just enough to get usb-eth working. I.e.
endpoints 0-2, no dma. Performance isn't stellar
partially due to UDC bug workarounds...
(~350K @ 100Mhz, ~550K @ 200Mhz).

Endpoint 1&2 have changed direction compared to
the SA, so the host side requires a change to
usbnet.c to flip endpoints (in:2/out:1 -> in:1/out:2).

usb-eth and usb-char for PXA are almost identical
to the SA versions, so they could probably be merged at
one point. I made some minor changes to the eth driver
to grab the usb resources at open, rather than at init
and allow eth&char to be loaded at the same time.

Stuart Lynne was working on his own USB client driver
(and he was getting higher throughput than my driver).
Assuming you guys have something in the oven for USB
as well, there should be good selection for best of
breed :)

Cheers,
Frank.
