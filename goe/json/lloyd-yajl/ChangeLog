	contribution.
0.4.0
     * lth buffer overflow bug in yajl_gen_double s/%lf/%g/ - thanks to
	Eric Bergstrome
     * lth yajl_number callback to allow passthrough of arbitrary precision
	numbers to client.  Thanks to Hatem Nassrat.
     * lth yajl_integer now deals in long, instead of long long.  This
	combined with yajl_number improves compiler compatibility while
	maintaining precision.
     * lth better ./configure && make experience (still requires cmake and
	ruby)
     * lth fix handling of special characters hex 0F and 1F in yajl_encode
	(thanks to Robert Geiger)

	parameter to scanf to zero.
     * lth all tests run 32x with ranging buffer sizes to stress stream
        parsing
     * lth yajl_test accepts -b option to allow read buffer size to be
        set
     * lth option to validate UTF8 added to parser (argument in
